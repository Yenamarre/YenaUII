Version 2.3
===========
- Fixed the "lag" on dragging waypoints.
- Un-throttled the location indicator, it should no longer appear to lag.
- Player blips can now be clicked to target.
- Player blip mouseovers now show class and health information
- Added a player count to BG info panes. Mouse over to see a breakdown by class.
- Added a server count to BG info panes. Shows the max % of players from one server, mouse over
  to see a breakdown by server.
- Added BG duration to BG info panes.
- Added scores to AB and WSG info panes.
- Added "time to win" and "bases to win" to AB pane.

Version 2.2.2
=============
- Fixed (again) the ZM workaround. Node updates should now display correctly.
- Added experimental support for French, thanks to Teomyr and Hasto. If anyone is interested
  in doing a complete translation for French please let me know.

Version 2.2.1
=============
- My ZM workaround was preventing node changes in AB and AV from displaying. I've backed out
  one of the checks I was doing to fix it. BFC will still work with ZM, but it will probably 
  slow your system down. There is nothing I can do about this, the author of Zeppelin Master
  needs to throttle the rate at which he zooms the map around.
- Fixed the location indicator once and for all. If for some reason it can't reference itself
  off the default location indicator in the BFC frame (this happens occasionally for some people)
  it will fall back to the indicator in the regular minimap. If you have the regular minimap
  minimized it will just hide the new location indicator and use the default one.

Version 2.2
===========
- Added a workaround for Zeppelin Master compatibility. These mods shouldn't conflict anymore.
- The location indicator will now work even if the minimap is hidden.

Version 2.1
===========
- Added new Arathi Basin module.
- Added keybindings to toggle the minimap.
- Reworked the player location indicator. The location of the player should now be much more visible.
- The waypoint panel can now be hidden.
- Waypoints now use the opacity of the map.
- Fixed a bug where map overlays would sometimes not use the correct opacity.
- The map will no longer forget its size.
- Attempting to use comms menus when not in a group will no longer cause a WoW error.
- The map cannot be opened inside of an instance (it was always empty inside of instances).
- The WSG plugin now resets flag carrier names properly when joining the instance.

Version 2.0 beta
================
- Major code rewrite! BFC is now modular, and supports per-zone helper
  plugins (for new battlegrounds, world PvP, or whatever). See Helper_WSG.lua
  for an example if you're thinking of making your own.
- No longer uses a chat channel to communicate, it uses the new mod
  communication system.
- Completely reworked waypointing system - just drag an icon onto the map
  to display it at that location. Drag it off the map to reset it.
- Pinging is now done by shift-clicking the map.
- Flag carriers are now shown in WSG, color-coded by class. Click their name to target
  them, if they are close enough. The time until the next rez wave is also displayed.
- There are now two comms menus, the old one that everyone is used to, and a zone-specific one
  that can be used by the helper plugins.

Version 1.4.1
=============
- current target indicator is now aligned correctly in narrow mode
- added German localization, courtesy of Teomyr.

Version 1.4
===========
- moved some strings to localization.lua to help with translation
- fixed the "map shrinks when zoning" bug
- added ability to automatically display when joining battlegrounds
- fixed the issues with areas appearing unexplored

Version 1.3.1
=============
- corrected the alpha channel on the grey blips

Version 1.3
===========
- fixed some issues with resource nodes being drawn under the terrain
- (hopefully) fixed some issues with areas appearing unexplored
- dead units will now appear as grey blips on the map

Version 1.2
===========
- opacity frame slider is now set to the correct position
- added support for patch 0.11
- player icons now turn red when the player is in combat
- added a 'current target' indicator, handy for figuring out where your current target is on the map
