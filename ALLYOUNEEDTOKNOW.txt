Ok, so this is the first and only version i released at this time (18:10:2018)

Im not claiming this as the best ui ever, there is surely lot of many interesting addons to use,
It is my set to go, it's not heavy Ui, mostly light you can set it up lighter if you run low config.

With this addons choice in UI can just ensure you run a correct addons setting, allow you peacefully playing
in pvp/pve, you just have to spend a few time to set this up correctly and you'll do great.


Special Thanks to nate, berg, photon, NikolaTesla, Annie..
